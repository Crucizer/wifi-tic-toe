Design of the app
(Small Scale)


Name: " "

maybe
show all the available names on the network
"Ayush" "Parth" "Someone"

user can click on the one they want to play with

can send a request to accept -> "Player " " wants to play with you"

Since this is a two person game
creating room doesn't make sense?
maybe joining two people makes it a room? The user doesn't need to know about the room

can make the room with the user name

then show all the rooms

then other user can join one.

yeah that looks about alright

will implement this later
for now, lets just make the tic tac toe on the server side
makes sense


single user shouldn't make two moves simultaneously
there is once method for this in socket
